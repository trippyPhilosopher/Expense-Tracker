# Expense Tracking App

## Abstract
This project is about creating an expense-tracking app for Android, aimed at helping users gain better insights into their finances. The app features expense tracking, forecasting using a random forest regression model, and analytics charts to support informed decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Expense Tracking**: Log and categorise expenses for better financial management.
- **Forecasting**: Utilises a random forest regression model for accurate financial predictions.
- **Analytics Charts**: Visualises data to aid in financial decision-making.
- **Import CSV Files**: Easily import expense data from CSV files for quick setup.
- **Local Data Storage**: Built using Isar for efficient data management.

## Development
The app was developed using:
- **Flutter SDK**: For building the cross-platform app.
- **Dart SDK**: As the programming language.
- **Isar**: A local database for storing user data efficiently.

### Techniques Used
- **Sliding Window Technique**: Applied to improve the accuracy of the random forest regression model.
- **Data Visualisation**: Charts implemented for clear representation of financial data.

## Challenges Faced
- Slow response times with large datasets.
- Performance optimisation issues.
- Need for preprocessing CSV datasets before use.

## Testing
The app underwent thorough testing to evaluate its functionality, performance, and data integrity. Areas needing improvement included:
- Error handling.
- User feedback mechanisms.

## Impact
This project contributes to mobile app development, financial technology, and data analytics by emphasising:
- Local data storage.
- Clear data visualisation.
- Enhanced user engagement.
